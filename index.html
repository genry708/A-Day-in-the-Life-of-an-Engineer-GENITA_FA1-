	      <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
	      <p>My day as an engineer usually starts around 7:00 am. After a quick breakfast, I prepare my plans and check my schedule for the 
			day. I wear my usual collared shirt, pants, and safety shoes, ready to visit the construction site or the office.
			I often start my morning reviewing blueprints, checking the progress of ongoing projects, and discussing plans with my team.
		  </p>
	      <p>Some days are spent, surrounded by axhines, workers, and the sound of construction. Other days are quieter. I stay in the office, 
			focusing on deisgns and reports. I like how everyday feels different but always purposeful.

	      <h2>Midday Tasks & Projects</h2>
	      <p>By midday, I'm usually deep into projects. I work closely with architects, technicians, and 
			project managers to mame sure everything follows the plan.</p>
	      <p>I also use tools like AutoCAD for designs and spreadsheets for analyzing materials and costs. 
			I really like that engineering isn't nust about calculations, it's also about problem-solving. 
			Sometimes, things don't go exactly as planned, but finding solutions is what makes the job rewarding.

	      <h2>A Story from My Dream Job</h2>
	      <p>One story that really inspired me as an aspiring engineer is about Aisa Mijeno, a Filipino engineer who invented the SALT 
			Lamp, a light powered by saltwater. She got the idea when she visited a remote community in Kalinga that didn’t have access
			 to electricity. The people there used kerosene lamps every night, which were not only costly but also dangerous.</p>
	      <p>Instead of just feeling bad, she decided to do something about it. Using her skills and creativity, she designed a simple 
			lamp that could run on saltwater — something the villagers already had. For me, that’s what being an engineer is all about: 
			finding ways to make people’s lives better using what you know. Her invention might look small, but its impact was huge. It 
			showed me that even a single idea can light up someone’s world — literally.</p>
